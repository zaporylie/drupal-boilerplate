# Data-only container
#
# This is a container without any running process. Will be stooped right after
# creation. As long as you won't delete it it will hold mysql data for you.
datamysql:
  # We don't want to waist space on your disk so instead of having new, small
  # container (like busybox) let's use the same image as for mysql deamon.
  image: mysql:5.5
  # No need to run process so change entry point to echo
  entrypoint: /bin/echo
  # Display "MySQL data-only container" message if container will be started
  command: MySQL data-only container

# Data-only container
#
# This is another container without any process involved. Will hold files in
# strict structure. You can mount more than only one volume but /app is required
# by [drupal] container.
datadrupal:
  # It takes zaporylie/drupal parent image
  # @see https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/zaporylie/drupal
  image: zaporylie/drupal
  # Gets parent folder (for this file) and mount it as /app
  volumes:
    - ./:/app
  # No need to run process so change entry point to echo
  entrypoint: /bin/echo
  # Display "APP data-only container" message if container will be started
  command: APP data-only container

# MySQL process container
#
# This container will run mysql deamon for you with data from [datamysql]

# Drupal container
#
# This container will run standard apache, php, sshd configuration
drupal:
  # apache, php, sshd - all you need (mysql in separate container).
  # supervisor takes care to run all services for you.

    # zaporylie/drupal to be sure what excacly install means in that case).
    # If /root/pre-install.sh or /root/post-install.sh will be mounted to
    # container you can use it to specify some additional installation
    # procedures.

    # If you want to use sql-sync-like automate procedures, we need authorized
    # keys here.
    # You will be also allowed to ssh into container from another authorized
    # host (as root).
    # If you are using vagrant-host from drupal-boilerplate:
    # - /home/vagrant/identity:/root/.ssh
    - ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh
    # If you want to run database from sql-dump file, mount it in /var/backups/db
    # and set right sync method.

  # Links to mysql process (via socket).
